Small experimental exercise using opengl and rust, lot's of unsafe code =P

#### Todo's
1. create buffer objects other with data types different then f32's, use a Vec and enums to specify default attribs, like position and color
2. more shader modes.. 
3. use multiple vbo's on vao, instead of one big large buffer ( relates to #1 )
